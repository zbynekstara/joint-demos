# JointJS+: Kitchen Sink App (JavaScript) <a href="https://www.jointjs.com/jointjs-plus"><img src="../../jointjs-plus-badge.svg" alt="JointJS+" width="123" align="right" /></a>

This application showcases the JointJS+ plugins in action and shows how the plugins
can be combined together. You can use this demo app as a reference for your own application
development.

This demo is also available online at [jointjs.com](https://jointjs.com/demos/kitchen-sink).

## How to download this demo

You can download this demo using our [`@joint/cli` tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@joint/cli):

```bash
npx @joint/cli download kitchen-sink/js
```

Alternatively, you can get the [copy of the repository](https://github.com/clientIO/joint-demos/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from GitHub as usual.

## Running the application

To run this application you need to have access to JointJS+ package. You can get it by having a JointJS+ license or by starting a [free trial](https://www.jointjs.com/free-trial).

If you are a trial user, you received your access token during the trial sign-up process.
If you are a customer, log in to the customer portal at https://my.jointjs.com to obtain your access token.

This example uses `.npmrc` file to set up access to the JointJS+ private npm registry. By default it uses `JOINTJS_NPM_TOKEN` environment variable to get authentication token. You can set this environment variable in your terminal or CI environment in the following way:

**macOS / Linux**:
```sh
export JOINTJS_NPM_TOKEN="jjs-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**:
```sh
$env:JOINTJS_NPM_TOKEN="jjs-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Learn more about our [private npm registry here.](https://docs.jointjs.com/learn/help-center/npm-registry)

After setting up access to JointJS+ package, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

And then start the application with:

```bash
npm start
```

## Develop the application

The source code is meant to serve as a boilerplate for your application. You are encouraged to start editing the source files to tailor the application to your needs.

Here is the breakdown of the folders in this project:

### `./js`

All _JS_ source codes. The entry point to the application is `./js/index.js`.

### `./js/config`

This application introduces various JSON configuration files for quick application customization.
Note that everything you configure here using JSON can be also done programmatically using the JointJS API.

- `font-style-sheet.js` - add additional fonts that are used on export to SVG or PNG
- `halo.js` - add/remove element tools
- `inspector.js` - define inputs in the property editor on the right
- `sample-graphs.js` - JSON (serialized) representation of the default graph shown on startup
- `selection.js` - add/remove selection tools
- `stencil.js` - define groups and shapes in the element palette on the left
- `toolbar.js` - add/remove toolbar tools in the toolbar at the top

### `./js/shapes`

The application uses built-in shapes and introduces several custom ones.

Note that in _JointJS_ terminology, the `graph` (model for a `paper` or canvas) contains of `cells` (shapes). A `cell` is either an `element` (node) or a `link` (edge).

- `links.js` - if you want to introduce a new custom link to your app or modify the default link, check out this file.
- `navigator.js` - custom element view that renders simplified shapes inside the navigator.
- `stencil-highlighter.js` - custom highlighter view that renders a rectangle below a shape that is being hovered in stencil

### `./js/views`

The application organizes its interfaces into logical views.

- `main.js` - the main application view that initializes the application components and configures the interactions.

### `./assets`

Static files (e.g fonts, icons) served from the local server to the browser.

### `./css`

Various CSS stylesheets.
