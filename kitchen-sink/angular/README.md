# JointJS+: Kitchen Sink App (Angular) <a href="https://www.jointjs.com/jointjs-plus"><img src="../../jointjs-plus-badge.svg" alt="JointJS+" width="123" align="right" /></a>

This application showcases the JointJS+ plugins in action and shows how the plugins
can be combined together. You can use this demo app as a reference for your own application
development.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

This demo is also available online at [jointjs.com](https://jointjs.com/demos/kitchen-sink).

## How to download this demo

You can download this demo using our [`@joint/cli` tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@joint/cli):

```

Alternatively, you can get the [copy of the repository](https://github.com/clientIO/joint-demos/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from GitHub as usual.

## Running the application

To run this application you need to have access to JointJS+ package. You can get it by having a JointJS+ license or by starting a [free trial](https://www.jointjs.com/free-trial).

If you are a trial user, you received your access token during the trial sign-up process.
If you are a customer, log in to the customer portal at https://my.jointjs.com to obtain your access token.

This example uses `.npmrc` file to set up access to the JointJS+ private npm registry. By default it uses `JOINTJS_NPM_TOKEN` environment variable to get authentication token. You can set this environment variable in your terminal or CI environment in the following way:

**macOS / Linux**:
```sh
export JOINTJS_NPM_TOKEN="jjs-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**:
```sh
$env:JOINTJS_NPM_TOKEN="jjs-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Learn more about our [private npm registry here.](https://docs.jointjs.com/learn/help-center/npm-registry)

After setting up access to JointJS+ package, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```
